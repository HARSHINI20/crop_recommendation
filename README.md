 crop_recommendation
 
ðŸ’« Introduction:
Agriculture is a cornerstone of many economies, especially in rural areas, where it serves as a primary source of income. However, agricultural productivity often suffers due to inefficient crop selection. Traditional methods are often outdated or lack accurate data regarding environmental conditions, leading to suboptimal yields.

ðŸ’«Objective: The ML-Based Intelligent Crop Recommendation System with Real-Time IoT Integration leverages machine learning and IoT to provide farmers with actionable insights to select the most suitable crops based on soil nutrients, pH, moisture, temperature, and rainfall. This data-driven approach promotes precision agriculture, optimizing resources and enhancing crop yield through sustainable practices.

ðŸ’«Problem Statement:
Agricultural productivity can be limited by poor crop selection that doesnâ€™t align with the soil or environmental conditions. Many farmers rely on historical knowledge or experience, which can be inefficient. With increasing challenges from climate change and unpredictable weather patterns, accurate data-driven insights are essential.

ðŸ’«Solution: This system continuously collects real-time data from IoT sensors (e.g., soil nutrients, moisture, temperature) and processes it through machine learning algorithms to recommend suitable crops. By choosing crops optimized for specific field conditions, farmers can make informed, data-driven decisions.

ðŸ’«Algorithms Used:

The project utilizes the following machine learning algorithms:
1. Logistic Regression: A basic classification model used to predict categorical outcomes.
 
2. Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and
merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

3. Decision Tree Classifier: A decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their
possible consequences
